# Valorant Client Wrapper
A php wrapper for authenticating user for Valorant Client APIs

## How to install
```
composer require weedeej/authspace:dev-master
```

## Usage

Auth using username and password
```PHP
use Weedeej\AuthSpace\Authentication;

$authObject = new Authentication(["username"=>"myUsername69",
                       		  "password"=>"s3cuReP4ss420",
                       		  "shard"=>"ap"]);
$authTokens = $authObject->authByUsername(); //Password is the most required key here.
```

Auth using Tokens
```PHP
use Weedeej\AuthSpace\Authentication;

$authObject = new Authentication(["username"=>"token.fetched.from.my.other.repo",
                         	  "shard"=>"ap"]); 
$authTokens = $authObject->authByToken();//If password is defined, 
					 //this will return an error.
```

Remembering Cookies
```PHP
/*Remembering Cookies not credentials for Re-auth

NOTE: "remember" should be set on true*/
const remember = ["username"=>"myUsername69",
                  "password"=>"s3cuReP4ss420",
                  "shard"=>"ap",
                  "remember"=>true];

public function rememberMe(){
    $authObject = new Authentication(self::remember);
    $authTokens = $authObj->authByUsername();
    return $authTokens;
}

/* Parameters on Authentication object should be 'null' */
public function reAuth(){
    $authObject = new Authentication();
    $authTokens = $authObj->reAuth();
    return $authTokens;
}
```
To get the token required, There so many ways to get it. But I recommend my project
[VTACCESS](https://github.com/weedeej/val-token-fetcher) as it copies that token instead of being displayed.
